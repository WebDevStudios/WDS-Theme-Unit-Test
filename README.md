# WDS-Theme-Unit-Test

This file contains data to test (CSS against) a plethora of markup that is commonly used in WDS WordPress themes.

In the past we've used tools like: [WPTest.io](http://wptest.io/), [WPfill.me](http://www.wpfill.me/), and WordPress.org's [Theme Unit Test](https://wpcom-themes.svn.automattic.com/demo/theme-unit-test-data.xml). We'll probably try to pick from each, and make a super-duper theme unit test (now known as TUT).

PRs are welcome.

## Installation

Go to Tools > Import and install the WordPress Importer (if not already installed). Import, and profit.
